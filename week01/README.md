# Overview

As a software student, I am always looking to learn more and improve the skills I already have. My goal is to learn new languages and become more fluent in the ones that I already know by developing programs in languages new to me, and creating more complex ones in languages I have already learned.  

## Description

This particular section will demonstrate the first thing that I ever learned, how to print a 'Hello World' statement in the Python language. 

It was created to show the simplicity of how to write a print statement in Python. 

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration.  It should be a one minute demo of the software running and a walkthrough of the code.}

# Development Environment

This program uses VS Code and GitHub. VS Code was used to actually write the program, and a GitHub repository is being utilized to publicly dispay the code.

Python first came about in the early 1990's in the Netherlands. It was designed by  Guido van Rossum, and the name Python came from his favorite TV show, *Monty Python's Flying Circus*. Python is a language that can be used daily in a variety of projects and industries.
